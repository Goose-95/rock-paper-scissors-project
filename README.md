# rock-paper-scissors-project
Odin Project rock paper scissors javascript project.

project was designed to practice basic javascript principles such as variables, functions, loops, DOM manipulation, etc.

the initial version was played entirely via the console and alerts. Revisited it after a few lessons to add UI elements and events to make it more interactive, as well as clean things up.
